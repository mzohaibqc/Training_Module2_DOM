Our perpetual connectedness gives us endless opportunities to be part of the give-and-take of networking. Some worry that this new environment makes us isolated and lonely. But in Networked, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman show how the large, loosely knit social circles of networked individuals expand opportunities for learning, problem solving, decision making, and personal interaction. The new social operating system of \"networked individualism\" liberates us from the restrictions of tightly knit groups; it also requires us to develop networking skills and strategies, work on maintaining ties, and balance multiple overlapping networks. Rainie and Wellman outline the \"triple revolution\" that has brought on this transformation: the rise of social networking, the capacity of the Internet to empower individuals, and the always-on connectivity of mobile devices. Drawing on extensive evidence, they examine how the move to networked individualism has expanded personal relationships beyond households and neighborhoods; transformed work into less hierarchical, more team-driven enterprises; encouraged individuals to create and share content; and changed the way people obtain information. Rainie and Wellman guide us through the challenges and opportunities of living in the evolving world of networked individuals.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bYJGna0AhdAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Networked.html?hl=&id=bYJGna0AhdAC","pageCount":376,"rating":3,"publishedDate":"2012-04-27"},{"title":"Operating System Security","authors":["Trent Jaeger"],"description":"\"Operating systems provide the fundamental mechanisms for securing computer processing. Since the 1960s, operating systems designers have explored how to build\"secure\" operating systems - operating systems whose mechanisms protect the system against a motivated adversary. Recently, the importance of ensuring such security has become a mainstream issue for all operating systems. In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements. For system designs that aimed to satisfy these requirements,we see that the complexity of software systems often results in implementation challenges that we are still exploring to this day. However, if a system design does not aim for achieving the secure operating system requirements, then its security features fail to protect the system in a myriad of ways. We also study systems that have been retro-fit with secure operating system features after an initial deployment. In all cases, the conflict between function on one hand and security on the other leads to difficult choices and the potential for unwise compromises. From this book, we hope that systems designers and implementers will learn the requirements for operating systems that effectively enforce security and will better understand how to manage the balance between function and security.\"--BOOK JACKET.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Operating_System_Security.html?hl=&id=P4PYPSv8nBMC","pageCount":218,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2008"},{"title":"Operating Systems","authors":["William Stallings"],"description":"Serving as both a basic reference and a survey of the state of the art, this text covers the concepts, structure, and mechanisms of operating systems.

Davidson"],"description":"The subject of C*-algebras received a dramatic revitalization in the 1970s by the introduction of topological methods through the work of Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore on extensions of C*-algebras and Elliott's use of K-theory to provide a useful classification of AF algebras. These results were the beginning of a marvelous new set of tools for analyzing concrete C*-algebras. This book is an introductory graduate level text which presents the basics of the subject through a detailed analysis of several important classes of C*-algebras. The development of operator algebras in the last twenty years has been based on a careful study of these special classes. While there are many books on C*-algebras and operator algebras available, this is the first one to attempt to explain the real examples that researchers use to test their hypotheses. Topic include AF algebras, Bunce-Deddens and Cuntz algebras, the Toeplitz algebra, irrational rotation algebras, group C*-algebras, discrete crossed products, abelian C*-algebras (spectral theory and approximate unitary equivalence) and extensions. It also introduces many modern concepts and results in the subject such as real rank zero algebras, topological stable rank, quasidiagonality, and various new constructions. These notes were compiled during the author's participation in the special year on C*-algebras at the Fields Institute of Mathematics during the 1994-1995 academic year. The field of C*-algebras touches upon many other areas of mathematics such as group representations, dynamical systems, physics, K-theory, and topology. The variety of examples offered in this text expose the student to many of these connections. A graduate student with a solid course in functional analysis should be able to read this book. This should prepare them to read much of the current literature. This book is reasonably self-contained, and the author has provided results from other areas when necessary.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0TXteNfrzvcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/C_algebras_by_Example.html?hl=&id=0TXteNfrzvcC","pageCount":309},{"title":"An Invitation to C*-Algebras","authors":["W. Arveson"],"description":"This book gives an introduction to C*-algebras and their representations on Hilbert spaces. We have tried to present only what we believe are the most basic ideas, as simply and concretely as we could. So whenever it is convenient (and it usually is), Hilbert spaces become separable and C*-algebras become GCR. This practice probably creates an impression that nothing of value is known about other C*-algebras. Of course that is not true. But insofar as representations are con cerned, we can point to the empirical fact that to this day no one has given a concrete parametric description of even the irreducible representations of any C*-algebra which is not GCR. Indeed, there is metamathematical evidence which strongly suggests that no one ever will (see the discussion at the end of Section 3. 4). Occasionally, when the idea behind the proof of a general theorem is exposed very clearly in a special case, we prove only the special case and relegate generalizations to the exercises. In effect, we have systematically eschewed the Bourbaki tradition. We have also tried to take into account the interests of a variety of readers. For example, the multiplicity theory for normal operators is contained in Sections 2. 1 and 2. 2. (it would be desirable but not necessary to include Section 1. 1 as well), whereas someone interested in Borel structures could read Chapter 3 separately. Chapter I could be used as a bare-bones introduction to C*-algebras.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

Twenty cases involving widespread success from Brazil, Burkina Faso, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, and Sri Lanka are presented, and are supported by field- and community-level data from more than 50 projects and programs in 28 countries. Despite this emerging evidence, many farmers still depend on high levels of external inputs. Regenerating Agriculture, identifies the common elements of successful programs and shows how those still using \"modernist\" approaches to agriculture can successfully turn to sustainable farming. The first chapter outlines the scale of the challenge and includes analysis of sustainable agriculture's characteristics and underlying philosophies and values. Pretty then presents analyses of the processes of agricultural modernization, focusing on both production- and conservation-oriented programs and policies and the common elements of success. Almost all of these successes have been achieved despite existing, biased policy environments that strongly favor \"modern\" approaches to agricultural development, and at the same time discriminate against sustainability.

Those who worry about personal privacy and identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon these rights--still use Orwell's \"Big Brother\" language to discuss privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to destroy the rights we've assumed were ours.Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century shows how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril.Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the popular hardcover edition of Database Nation is his compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy, identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control easier than ever before?Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity before it's too late.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mji4KPEqV3AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Database_Nation.html?hl=&id=Mji4KPEqV3AC","pageCount":338,"rating":3,"publishedDate":"2000-12-04"},{"title":"Six-Step Relational Database Design","authors":["Fidel A.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of multimedia databases and underlines the new requirements for these applications. Chapter 2 discusses the techniques used for storing and retrieving multimedia objects. Chapter 3 presents the techniques used for generating metadata for various media objects. Chapter 4 examines the mechanisms used for storing the index information needed for accessing different media objects. Chapter 5 analyzes the approaches for modeling media objects, both their temporal and spatial characteristics. Object-oriented approach, with some additional features, has been widely used to model multimedia information. The book discusses two systems that use object-oriented models: OVID (Object Video Information Database) and Jasmine. The models for representing temporal and spatial requirements of media objects are then studied. The book also describes authoring techniques used for specifying temporal and spatial characteristics of multimedia databases. Chapter 6 explains different types of multimedia queries, the methodologies for processing them and the language features for describing them. The features offered by query languages such as SQL/MM (Structured Query Language for Multimedia), PICQUERY+, and Video SQL are also studied. Chapter 7 deals with the communication requirements for multimedia databases. A client accessing multimedia data over computer networks needs to identify a schedule for retrieving various media objects composing the database. The book identifies possible ways for generating a retrieval schedule. Chapter 8 ties together the techniques discussed in the previous chapters by providing a simple architecture of a distributed multimedia database management system. Multimedia Database Management Systems can be used as a text for graduate students and researchers working in the area of multimedia databases. In addition, the book serves as essential reading material for computer professionals who are in (or moving to) the area of multimedia databases.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zeNKPYnOuzEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Multimedia_Database_Management_Systems.html?hl=&id=zeNKPYnOuzEC","pageCount":206,"publishedDate":"1997"},{"title":"A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture","description":"Containing more than five thousand entries, an authoritative dictionary of architecture covers all periods of Western architectural history, from ancient times to the present day.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jIWr0IO9dYIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Dictionary_of_Architecture_and_Landsca.html?hl=&id=jIWr0IO9dYIC","pageCount":880,"publishedDate":"2006-02-23"},{"title":"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture","authors":["Robert Venturi"],"description":"Foreword by Arthur Drexler.

In Enterprise Architecture as Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution, authors Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill, and David C. Robertson show you how. The key? Make tough decisions about which processes you must execute well, then implement the IT systems needed to digitize those processes. Citing numerous companies worldwide, the authors show how constructing the right enterprise architecture enhances profitability and time to market, improves strategy execution, and even lowers IT costs. Though clear, engaging explanation, they demonstrate how to define your operating model—your vision of how your firm will survive and grow—and implement it through your enterprise architecture.

Architecture and Disjunction, which brings together Tschumi's essays from 1975 to 1990, is a lucid and provocative analysis of many of the key issues that have engaged architectural discourse over the past two decades -- from deconstructive theory to recent concerns with the notions of event and program. The essays develop different themes in contemporary theory as they relate to the actual making of architecture, attempting to realign the discipline with a new world culture characterized by both discontinuity and heterogeneity. Included are a number of seminal essays that incited broad attention when they first appeared in magazines and journals, as well as more recent and topical texts. Tschumi's discourse has always been considered radical and disturbing. He opposes modernist ideology and postmodern nostalgia since both impose restrictive criteria on what may be deemed \"legitimate\" cultural conditions. He argues for focusing on our immediate cultural situation, which is distinguished by a new postindustrial \"unhomeliness\" reflected in the ad hoc erection of buildings with multipurpose programs. The condition of New York and the chaos of Tokyo are thus perceived as legitimate urban forms.

Giachetti"],"description":"In practice, many different people with backgrounds in many different disciplines contribute to the design of an enterprise. Anyone who makes decisions to change the current enterprise to achieve some preferred structure is considered a designer. What is problematic is how to use the knowledge of separate aspects of the enterprise to achieve a globally optimized enterprise. The synthesis of knowledge from many disciplines to design an enterprise defines the field of enterprise engineering. Because enterprise systems are exceedingly complex, encompassing many independent domains of study, students must first be taught how to think about enterprise systems. Specifically written for advanced and intermediate courses and modules, Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods takes a system-theoretical perspective of the enterprise. It describes a systematic approach, called the enterprise design method, to design the enterprise. The design method demonstrates the principles, models, methods, and tools needed to design enterprise systems. The author uses the enterprise system design methodology to organize the chapters to mimic the completion of an actual project. Thus, the book details the enterprise engineering process from initial conceptualization of an enterprise to its final design. Pedagogical tools available include: For instructors: PowerPoint® slides for each chapter Project case studies that can be assigned as long-term projects to accompany the text Quiz questions for each chapter Business Process Analyzer software available for download For students: Templates, checklists, forms, and models to support enterprise engineering activities The book fills a need for greater design content in engineering curricula by describing how to design enterprise systems. Inclusion of design is also critical for business students, since they must realize the import their decisions may have on the long-term design of the enterprises they work with. The book’s practical focus and project-based approach coupled with the pedagogical tools gives students the knowledge and skills they need to lead enterprise engineering projects.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vecMWppA9qgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Design_of_Enterprise_Systems.html?hl=&id=vecMWppA9qgC","pageCount":447,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2011-05-19"},{"title":"Architecture and Violence","authors":["Bechir Kenzari"],"description":"\"In today's turbulent times few subjects deserve a closer scrutiny than the interactions between violence and constructed environment.

It's even more of that \"Ah ha, so that' s how they do it,\" straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff people can really use today, and that made volume 1 the world's best-selling book on digital photography. This book truly has a brilliant premise, and here's how Scott describes it: \"If you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, 'Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?' I wouldn't give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, I'd just turn to you and say, 'Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.' Well, that's what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I've learned, just like I would with a friend--without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.\" Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If you're tired of taking shots that look \"okay,\" and if you're tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, \"Why don't my shots look like that?\" then this is the book for you. This isn't a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With another 200 of the most closely guarded photographic \"tricks of the trade,\" this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oguv4zV3lAoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Digital_Photography_Book.html?hl=&id=oguv4zV3lAoC","pageCount":240,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2012-02-27"},{"title":"Photography","authors":["Pierre Bourdieu"],"description":"The everyday practice of photography by millions of amateur photographers may seem to be a spontaneous and highly personal activity. but France's leading sociologist and cultural theorist Pierre Bourdieu and his research associates show that few cultural activities are more structural and systematic than photography. This perceptive and wide-ranging analysis of the practice of photography reveals the logic implicit in this cultural field. For some social groups, photography is primarily a means of preserving the present and reproducing moments of collective celebration, whereas for other groups it is the occasion of an aesthetic judgment in which photos are endowed with the dignity of works of art. Bourdieu and his associates examine the socially differentiated forms of photographic practice by drawing on the results of surveys and interviews and by analyzing the attitudes and characteristics of both amateur and professional photographers.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lsy-Kd_BmgwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Photography.html?hl=&id=Lsy-Kd_BmgwC","pageCount":218,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"1996"},{"title":"Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography","authors":["John Hannavy"],"description":"The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography is the first comprehensive encyclopedia of world photography up to the beginning of the twentieth century.

Since the early 1990s, the number of photography book publishers has continued to grow while technological developments have placed more tools for bookmaking directly in the hands of photographers. For the students and working artists who have chosen photography as their primary means of expression, having their own photography book is seen as a passport to the international photography scene. Yet, few have more than a tentative grasp of the component parts of a book, an understanding of what they want to express, or the know-how needed to get a book published. Publish Your Photography Book is the first book to demystify the process of producing and publishing a book of photographs. Industry insiders Darius D. Himes and Mary Virginia Swanson survey the current landscape of photography book publishing and point out the many avenues to pursue and pitfalls to avoid. This expert guide is organized in six sections covering the rich history of the photo book; anoverview of the publishing industry; an intimate look at the process of making a book; a close review of how to market aphoto book; a section on case studies, built around discussions and interviews with published photographers; and a final section presenting a wealth of resources and information to aid in the understanding of the publishing world. Publish Your Photography Book also includes a number of additional interviews and contributions from industry professionals, including artists, publishers, designers, packagers, editors, and other industry experts who openly share their publishing experiences.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c3pJSAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Publish_Your_Photography_Book.html?hl=&id=c3pJSAAACAAJ","pageCount":224,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2011-03-23"},{"title":"A Concise History of Photography","authors":["Helmut Gernsheim"],"description":"Highly acclaimed, scholarly volume examines technological advances and artistic development, with nearly 300 examples of photographic art. 285 black-and-white photos.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GDSRJQ3BZ5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Concise_History_of_Photography.html?hl=&id=GDSRJQ3BZ5EC","pageCount":150,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"1986"},{"title":"Optics in Photography","authors":["Rudolf Kingslake"],"description":"This book explains fundamental optical principles that apply to photography, cameras, and lenses.

The relationships between photography and time are manifold: time can be directly represented within the image, it can be its theme and philosophical horizon, but it can also represent the global framework in which photographic practices develop and change through time. It is the ambition of this book to bring together the various aspects of time in photography as well as photography in time, and to illustrate them in a series of case studies that focus on seminal authors (e.g. Fox Talbot, Victor Burgin, Robert Morris) and genres (e.g. spirit photography, montage photobooks and tableau photography). The selected examples range from the very first photographic pictures to the most recent cross-medial uses of photography in and outside art. Written by international specialists for a non-specialist audience and displaying extraordinary breadth and erudition, this book reshapes our vision of photography in order to include many crucial yet overlooked aspects of time, culture and art.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z1KogIdIzYgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Time_and_Photography.html?hl=&id=Z1KogIdIzYgC","pageCount":187,"publishedDate":"2010"},{"title":"Islam","authors":["Sue Penney"],"description":"This foundation edition on Islam is part of a series aimed at lower-ability pupils.

It covers topics ranging from the physics and aesthetics of sound, the nature of music, its place in the total scheme of things and in human life, the relation between music, astronomy, astrology and meteorology, the relation between music and human feelings, character and behavour, to the question of whether a good Muslim should be allowed to listen to music at all, and if so, to which sorts. The book traces the influence of Greek, in particular Pythagorean and Aristoxenian, thinking in Islam on this subject, and aims to provide a philosophically coherent statement of thinking of the Islamic writers concerned, a clarification of their central arguments, as well as a critical evaluation of their line of thought. The author introduces a wide range of material from manuscript sources, including much that has not been published before.

Patel"],"description":"In the first comprehensive study of the relationship between music and language from the standpoint of cognitive neuroscience, Aniruddh D. Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.Winner of the 2008 ASCAP Deems Taylor Award","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EkItxyZqNecC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Music_Language_and_the_Brain.html?hl=&id=EkItxyZqNecC","pageCount":513,"rating":3.5,"publishedDate":"2008"},{"title":"Cultivating Music","authors":["David Gramit"],"description":"German and Austrian music of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries stands at the heart of the Western musical canon. In this innovative study of various cultural practices (such as music journalism and scholarship, singing instruction, and concerts), David Gramit examines how music became an important part of middle-class identity. He investigates historical discourses around such topics as the aesthetic debates over the social significance of folk music, various comparisons of the musical practices of ethnic \"others\" to the German \"norm,\" and the establishment of the concert as a privileged site of cultural activity. \"Cultivating Music\" analyzes the ideologies of German musical discourse during its formative period. Claiming music's importance to both social well-being and individual development, proponents of musical culture sought to secure the status of music as an art integral to bourgeois life. They believed that \"music\" referred to the autonomous musical work, meaningful in and of itself to those cultivated to experience it properly. The social limits to that cultivation ensured that boundaries of class, gender, and educational attainment preserved the privileged status of music despite (but also by means of) their claims for the \"universality\" of their canon. Departing from the traditional focus on individual musical works, Gramit considers the social history of the practice of music in Austro-German culture. He examines the origins of the privileged position of the Western canon in musicological discourses and argues that we cannot fully understand the role that canon has played without considering the interests that motivated its creators.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RrzMJCA4Oa4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Cultivating_Music.html?hl=&id=RrzMJCA4Oa4C","pageCount":283,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2001-12-03"},{"title":"The Harvard Dictionary of Music","authors":["Don Michael Randel"],"description":"This comprehensive single-volume music reference covers a wide range of topics, including all styles of Western music as well as the music of Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East, with articles by experts, short \"quick reference\" essays, and a wide range of instruments.

Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of–and in the words of–America's women, factory workers, African Americans, Native Americans, working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles–for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality–were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through the 2000 Election and the \"war on terrorism,\" A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981 and has sold more than one million copies, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.

Its spread has depended upon a reconstitution of state powers such that privatization, finance, and market processes are emphasized. State interventions in the economy are minimized, while the obligations of the state to provide for the welfare of its citizens are diminished. David Harvey, author of 'The New Imperialism' and 'The Condition of Postmodernity', here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage. While Thatcher and Reagan are often cited as primary authors of this neoliberal turn, Harvey shows how a complex of forces, from Chile to China and from New York City to Mexico City, have also played their part. In addition he explores the continuities and contrasts between neoliberalism of the Clinton sort and the recent turn towards neoconservative imperialism of George W. Bush. Finally, through critical engagement with this history, Harvey constructs a framework not only for analyzing the political and economic dangers that now surround us, but also for assessing the prospects for the more socially just alternatives being advocated by many oppositional movements.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F5DZvEVt890C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Brief_History_of_Neoliberalism.html?hl=&id=F5DZvEVt890C","pageCount":256,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2005-09-22"},{"title":"A Brief History of American Sports","authors":["Elliott J.

In Writing History, Writing Trauma, Dominick LaCapra provides a broad-ranging, critical inquiry into the problem of trauma, notably with respect to major historical events. In a series of interlocking essays, he explores theoretical and literary-critical attempts to come to terms with trauma as well as the crucial role post-traumatic testimonies—particularly Holocaust testimonies—have assumed in recent thought and writing. In doing so, he adapts psychoanalytic concepts to historical analysis and employs sociocultural and political critique to elucidate trauma and its after effects in culture and in people. In the first chapter LaCapra addresses trauma from the perspective of history as a discipline. He then lays a theoretical groundwork for the book as a whole, exploring the concept of historical specificity and insisting on the difference between transhistorical and historical trauma. Subsequent chapters consider how Holocaust testimonies raise the problem of the role of affect and empathy in historical understanding, and respond to the debates surrounding Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust. The book's concluding essay, \"Writing (About) Trauma,\" examines the various ways that the voice of trauma emerges in written and oral accounts of historical events. Theoretically ambitious and historically informed, Writing History, Writing Trauma is an important contribution from one of today's foremost experts on trauma.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yA5ms7rnSv0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Writing_History_Writing_Trauma.html?hl=&id=yA5ms7rnSv0C","pageCount":226,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2001"},{"title":"The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt","authors":["Ian Shaw"],"description":"The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt uniquely covers 700,000 years of ancient Egypt from the stone age to the Roman conquest.

A History of American Nursing: Trends and Eras is designed to inform and empower today’s student nurses as they help to create the future of nursing.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ebHj_6fCqRcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_American_Nursing.html?hl=&id=ebHj_6fCqRcC","pageCount":265,"publishedDate":"2010-10-25"},{"title":"Doing History","authors":["Mark Donnelly","Claire Norton"],"description":"\"History as an academic discipline has dramatically changed over the last few decades and has become much more exciting and varied as a result of ideas from other disciplines, the influence of postmodernism and historians' incorporation of their own theoretical reflections into their work. The way history is studied at university level can vary greatly from history at school or as represented in the media and Doing History bridges that gap. Aimed at students of history in their final year of secondary education or beginning degrees, this is the ideal introduction to studying history as an academic subject at university. \"Doing History\" presents the ideas and debates that shape how we \"do\" history today, covering arguments about nature of historical knowledge and the function of historical writing, whether we can really ever know what happened in the past, what sources historians depend on, and whether the historians' version of history has more value than popular histories. This practical and accessible introduction to the discipline introduces students to these key discussions, familiarises them with the important terms and issues, equips them with the necessary vocabulary and encourages them to think about, and engage with, these questions. Clearly structured and accessibly written, it is an essential volume for all students embarking on the study of history\"--","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtBbrykak2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Doing_History.html?hl=&id=PtBbrykak2wC","pageCount":237,"publishedDate":"2011"},{"title":"Cooking","authors":["James Peterson"],"description":"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated.

Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are: Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully The particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasure Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating.

In The Cooking of History he provides a comprehensive analysis of these assumptions, in the process offering an incisive critique both of the anthropology of religion and of scholarship on the cultural history of the Afro-Atlantic World. Understood largely through its rituals and ceremonies, Santería and related religions have been a challenge for anthropologists to link to a hypothetical African past. But, Palmié argues, precisely by relying on the notion of an aboriginal African past, and by claiming to authenticate these religions via their findings, anthropologists—some of whom have converted to these religions—have exerted considerable influence upon contemporary practices. Critiquing widespread and damaging simplifications that posit religious practices as stable and self-contained, Palmié calls for a drastic new approach that properly situates cultural origins within the complex social environments and scholarly fields in which they are investigated.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y4MYGfvqpbsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cooking_of_History.html?hl=&id=Y4MYGfvqpbsC","pageCount":344,"publishedDate":"2013-06-14"},{"title":"Royal Hyderabadi Cooking","authors":["Sanjeev Kapoor and Harpal Singh Sokhi"],"description":"Hyderabadi Cuisine is known to be irresistible.

LANDES","Richard A. Posner"],"description":"This book takes a fresh look at the most dynamic area of American law today, comprising the fields of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrecy, publicity rights, and misappropriation. Topics range from copyright in private letters to defensive patenting of business methods, from moral rights in the visual arts to the banking of trademarks, from the impact of the court of patent appeals to the management of Mickey Mouse. The history and political science of intellectual property law, the challenge of digitization, the many statutes and judge-made doctrines, and the interplay with antitrust principles are all examined. The treatment is both positive (oriented toward understanding the law as it is) and normative (oriented to the reform of the law). Previous analyses have tended to overlook the paradox that expanding intellectual property rights can effectively reduce the amount of new intellectual property by raising the creators' input costs. Those analyses have also failed to integrate the fields of intellectual property law. They have failed as well to integrate intellectual property law with the law of physical property, overlooking the many economic and legal-doctrinal parallels. This book demonstrates the fundamental economic rationality of intellectual property law, but is sympathetic to critics who believe that in recent decades Congress and the courts have gone too far in the creation and protection of intellectual property rights.

The Political Economy of Intellectual Property Law Conclusion Acknowledgments Index Reviews of this book: Chicago law professor William Landes and his polymath colleague Richard Posner have produced a fascinating new book...[The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law] is a broad-ranging analysis of how intellectual property should and does work...Shakespeare's copying from Plutarch, Microsoft's incentives to hide the source code for Windows, and Andy Warhol's right to copyright a Brillo pad box as art are all analyzed, as is the question of the status of the all-bran cereal called 'All-Bran.' --Nicholas Thompson, New York Sun Reviews of this book: Landes and Posner, each widely respected in the intersection of law and economics, investigate the right mix of protection and use of intellectual property (IP)...This volume provides a broad and coherent approach to the economics and law of IP. The economics is important, understandable, and valuable. --R. A. Miller, Choice Intellectual property is the most important public policy issue that most policymakers don't yet get. It is America's most important export, and affects an increasingly wide range of social and economic life. In this extraordinary work, two of America's leading scholars in the law and economics movement test the pretensions of intellectual property law against the rationality of economics. Their conclusions will surprise advocates from both sides of this increasingly contentious debate. Their analysis will help move the debate beyond the simplistic ideas that now tend to dominate. --Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law School, author of The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World An image from modern mythology depicts the day that Einstein, pondering a blackboard covered with sophisticated calculations, came to the life-defining discovery: Time = $$. Landes and Posner, in the role of that mythological Einstein, reveal at every turn how perceptions of economic efficiency pervade legal doctrine. This is a fascinating and resourceful book. Every page reveals fresh, provocative, and surprising insights into the forces that shape law. --Pierre N. Leval, Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit The most important book ever written on intellectual property. --William Patry, former copyright counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee Given the immense and growing importance of intellectual property to modern economies, this book should be welcomed, even devoured, by readers who want to understand how the legal system affects the development, protection, use, and profitability of this peculiar form of property. The book is the first to view the whole landscape of the law of intellectual property from a functionalist (economic) perspective. Its examination of the principles and doctrines of patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, and trademark law is unique in scope, highly accessible, and altogether greatly rewarding. --Steven Shavell, Harvard Law School, author of Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-KkvbT6F4UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/THE_ECONOMIC_STRUCTURE_OF_INTELLECTUAL_P.html?hl=&id=X-KkvbT6F4UC","pageCount":442,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2003"},{"title":"Management and Supervision in Law Enforcement","authors":["Kären Hess","Christine Hess Orthmann"],"description":"MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, 6th edition is a practical and straightforward book that focuses on law enforcement managers and supervisors, their jobs, and the complicated interrelationships between members of the law enforcement team and the communities they share.

R. Nafziger","Stephen F. Ross"],"description":"Despite taking a wide variety of forms, sport is universal. Circumstances and events generating legal issues in sport are similarly universal, but sport operates under many legal systems worldwide. Fragmentation and inconsistency in legal outcomes often result. This innovative collection of essays by leading scholars of sports law addresses a gap in the literature. It advances understanding of how different legal systems respond to common issues and offers insights into the developing international system of sports law. Researchers will find this book of inescapable assistance and interest. Hayden Opie, Melbourne Law School, Australia Nafziger and Ross have provided an enormously useful collection of incisive and integrating essays that cover the gamut of important issues in the emerging field of international sport law. Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College, US This Handbook presents a comprehensive collection of essays by leading scholars and practitioners in the burgeoning field of international sports law. The authors address significant legal issues on two gradually converging tracks: the mainstream institutional framework of the law, primarily the International Olympic Committee, international sports federations, regional and national sports authority, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport; and the commercial sports industry. Topics include the institutional structure; fundamental issues, legal principles and decisions within those institutions; mediation, arbitration and litigation of disputes; doping, gambling and the expanding use of technology in competition; athlete eligibility requirements; discrimination; and protection of athletes. The book also covers a broad range of commercial issues related to competition law and labor markets; media, image, and intellectual property rights; event sponsorships; and players' agents. Comparative analyses of young sports models and practices in North America, Europe and elsewhere supplement the general theme of international sports law. This major collection of essays on some of the most controversial, cutting-edge issues in international sports law, will be a captivating read for academics and students of sports law, sports management, international law and comparative law, as well as practicing lawyers and players agents. Senior executives and other professionals in the sports industry will also find much to interest them in this well-documented Handbook.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_on_International_Sports_Law.html?hl=&id=fnLI-OA0JtgC","pageCount":567,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2011"},{"title":"Essentials of Health Policy and Law","authors":["Joel Bern Teitelbaum","Sara E.

And many dream about writing one. But is it actually possible for an unpublished writer—armed with a good story idea and a love of kids—to write, sell, publish, and promote a book? Yes, it is! Veteran children's book publishing executive and author Lisa Rojany Buccieri and author Peter Economy show you how, in their incredibly useful 2005 first edition of Writing Children's Books For Dummies®. Buccieri and Economy begin by explaining the basics of the children's book business, from the nuts and bolts of the various formats and genres—with helpful illustrations to aid you—to the intricacies of the book publishing market, a list of recent award-winning books, and a first peek into the particular mind set that writing children's books requires. (Hint: Throw out the adult rules, and think like a kid!) Then the authors dive into the actual writing process itself, with tips on setting up a workspace, brainstorming great book ideas, researching the subject you decide on, even speaking with the sorts of kids you hope will eventually read the book. They show you how to create compelling characters and develop them in the manuscript; how to outline and write a plot \"arc\" of conflict, change, and resolution; how to master the difficult art of writing dialogue; and how to use active (rather than passive) language to keep your story moving along and interesting to young minds. Or, if you're planning to write a creative nonfiction children's book—on a topic such as science, nature, or a historical figure, for example—the authors include a chapter on this, too. Ready, set, go… it's time to sit down and write! Once you've finished your book, however, the process has only begun. Now you will refine, submit, and hopefully sell your manuscript. Here again, the authors of Writing Children's Books For Dummies come through for you. They deliver solid advice on hiring an illustrator—or not; participating in workshops and conferences to learn the business and hone a story; finding an agent; and, finally, submitting the manuscript to publishers and—if you are successful—signing a contract. Along the way, the authors also include tips on handling rejection; a quick primer on the various editors in publishing houses (and how they work to make your book its best); and making a plan to publicize the book, including hiring a publicist if necessary. Like all For Dummies® books, Writing Children's Books For Dummies highlights \"The Part of Tens,\" which includes the Ten Best Ways to Promote Your Story and More Than Ten Great Sources for Storylines. And the ever-helpful Cheat Sheet includes Tips for Editing your Children's Book Manuscript, Children's Book No-No's, Twelve Commandments for Writing Younger Children's Books, and Tips on Promotion. From setting down that first word on paper to doing a successful publicity tour, Writing Children's Books For Dummies gives you the confidence and the insiders' know-how to write and sell the story you've always wanted to write.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_9892XHBt3sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Writing_Children_s_Books_For_Dummies.html?hl=&id=_9892XHBt3sC","pageCount":384,"rating":3,"publishedDate":"2011-03-03"},{"title":"Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children","authors":["Betty Hart","Todd R.

How do biographical studies relate to other forms of history? Should historians use different approaches to biography, depending on the cultures of their subjects? What are the appropriate primary sources and techniques that scholars should use in writing biographies in their respective fields? In Writing Biography, six prominent historians address these issues and reflect on their varied experiences and divergent perspectives as biographers. Shirley A. Leckie examines the psychological and personal connections between biographer and subject; R. Keith Schoppa considers the pervasive effect of culture on the recognition of individuality and the presentation of a life; Retha M. Warnicke explores past context and modern cultural biases in writing the biographies of Tudor women; John Milton Cooper Jr. discusses the challenges of writing modern biographies and the interplay of the biographer?s own experiences; Nell Irvin Painter looks at the process of reconstructing a life when written documents are scant; and Robert J. Richards investigates the intimate relationship between life experiences and new ideas. Despite their broad range of perspectives, all six scholars agree on two central points: biography and historical analysis are inextricably linked, and biographical studies offer an important tool for analyzing historical questions.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N3x7HSOpIG0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Writing_Biography.html?hl=&id=N3x7HSOpIG0C","pageCount":166,"publishedDate":"2004"},{"title":"Mother India","authors":["Pranay Gupte"],"description":"Mother India is the fascinating story of independent India's most complex GUPTE political figure: Indira Gandhi, the enigmatic and solitary daughter of the country's first prime minister, who rose to become prime minister herself.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OOmK1lPWq80C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Mother_India.html?hl=&id=OOmK1lPWq80C","pageCount":660,"publishedDate":"2012-02"},{"title":"Steve Jobs","authors":["Walter Isaacson"],"description":"Draws on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs, as well as interviews with family members, friends, competitors, and colleagues to offer a look at the co-founder and leading creative force behind the Apple computer company.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8U2oAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Steve_Jobs.html?hl=&id=8U2oAAAAQBAJ","pageCount":630,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2013-09-10"},{"title":"A Brief History of American Sports","authors":["Elliott J.

R. Nafziger","Stephen F. Ross"],"description":"Despite taking a wide variety of forms, sport is universal. Circumstances and events generating legal issues in sport are similarly universal, but sport operates under many legal systems worldwide. Fragmentation and inconsistency in legal outcomes often result. This innovative collection of essays by leading scholars of sports law addresses a gap in the literature. It advances understanding of how different legal systems respond to common issues and offers insights into the developing international system of sports law. Researchers will find this book of inescapable assistance and interest. Hayden Opie, Melbourne Law School, Australia Nafziger and Ross have provided an enormously useful collection of incisive and integrating essays that cover the gamut of important issues in the emerging field of international sport law. Andrew Zimbalist, Smith College, US This Handbook presents a comprehensive collection of essays by leading scholars and practitioners in the burgeoning field of international sports law. The authors address significant legal issues on two gradually converging tracks: the mainstream institutional framework of the law, primarily the International Olympic Committee, international sports federations, regional and national sports authority, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport; and the commercial sports industry. Topics include the institutional structure; fundamental issues, legal principles and decisions within those institutions; mediation, arbitration and litigation of disputes; doping, gambling and the expanding use of technology in competition; athlete eligibility requirements; discrimination; and protection of athletes. The book also covers a broad range of commercial issues related to competition law and labor markets; media, image, and intellectual property rights; event sponsorships; and players' agents. Comparative analyses of young sports models and practices in North America, Europe and elsewhere supplement the general theme of international sports law. This major collection of essays on some of the most controversial, cutting-edge issues in international sports law, will be a captivating read for academics and students of sports law, sports management, international law and comparative law, as well as practicing lawyers and players agents. Senior executives and other professionals in the sports industry will also find much to interest them in this well-documented Handbook.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fnLI-OA0JtgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_on_International_Sports_Law.html?hl=&id=fnLI-OA0JtgC","pageCount":567,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2011"},{"title":"Deaf Sport","authors":["David Alan Stewart"],"description":"Deaf Sport describes the full ramifications of athletics for Deaf people, from the meaning of individual participation to the cultural bonding resulting from their organization.

Now other countries are catching up and leaping ahead--in high school graduation rates, in the quality and equity of their K-12 education systems, and in the proportion of students graduating from college. It is not that American education has gotten worse so much that education in other parts of the world has gotten so much better, so fast. Designed to promote conversation about how to educate students for a rapidly changing and increasingly borderless and innovation-based world, this comprehensive and illuminating book from international education expert Vivien Stewart is not about casting blame; it is about understanding what the best school systems in the world are doing right for the purpose of identifying what U.S. schools--at the national, state, and local level--might do differently and better. Here, you'll consider * How the U.S. education system fares against emerging international standards of excellence. * The policies, practices, and priorities of the world's best-performing systems, along with specific ideas for adapting these approaches for U.S. schools. * The common factors characteristic of high-performing and rapidly improving systems. * New models of 21st century teaching and leadership and ways to modernize curriculum, instruction, and assessment. * How technology and international exchange can help the United States close performance gaps and reach new levels of excellence and equity. Learning goes both ways, Stewart writes. Other countries have learned a great deal from the United States, and now it is time for American educators to open their eyes to other nations' globally-minded and future-focused practices, leverage existing assets, and create a truly world-class education system for this generation of students and generations to come.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kl7VLXGINeYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_World_class_Education.html?hl=&id=Kl7VLXGINeYC","pageCount":191,"publishedDate":"2012"},{"title":"Empowering Education","authors":["Ira Shor"],"description":"Ira Shor is a pioneer in the field of critical education who for over twenty years has been experimenting with learning methods. His work creatively adapts the ideas of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire for North American classrooms. In Empowering Education Shor offers a comprehensive theory and practice for critical pedagogy. For Shor, empowering education is a student-centered, critical and democratic pedagogy for studying any subject matter and for self and social change. It takes shape as a dialogue in which teachers and students mutually investigate everyday themes, social issues, and academic knowledge. Through dialogue and problem-posing, students become active agents of their learning. This book shows how students can develop as critical thinkers, inspired learners, skilled workers, and involved citizens. Shor carefully analyzes obstacles to and resources for empowering education, suggesting ways for teachers to transform traditional approaches into critical and democratic ones.

He begins with a discussion of what people want from their school systems, tracing their views of the kinds of knowledge, skills, and values education should impart, and their concerns about discipline, drugs, and violence in schools. Using this survey of goals and attitudes as a guide, Coulson sets out to compare the school systems of civilizations both ancient and modern, seeking to determine which systems achieved the aims of parents and the public at large and which did not. Drawing on the historical evidence of how these various systems operated, Coulson concludes that free educational markets have consistently done a better job of serving the public's needs than state-run school systems have.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3xi49dmYw0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Market_Education.html?hl=&id=3xi49dmYw0wC","pageCount":471,"rating":3},{"title":"Distance Education","authors":["Lee Ayers Schlosser","Michael R.

In accessible language, he explains why good health is crucial to economic development, what indicators help track changes in global health, and requirements for good health systems. Approaches to solving world health problems must be under pinned by good ethics and human rights guidelines, he says, and local practices and cultures must not be ignored.

Then, when the dot-com bubble burst and the economy cooled, many assumed the war for talent was over. It's not. Now the authors of the original study reveal that, because of enduring economic and social forces, the war for talent will persist for the next two decades. McKinsey & Company consultants Ed Michaels, Helen Handfield-Jones, and Beth Axelrod argue that winning the war for leadership talent is about much more than frenzied recruiting tactics. It's about the timeless principles of attracting, developing, and retaining highly talented managers-applied in bold new ways. And it's about recognizing the strategic importance of human capital because of the enormous value that better talent creates. Fortified by five years of in-depth research on how companies manage leadership talent-including surveys of 13,000 executives at more than 120 companies and case studies of 27 leading companies-the authors propose a fundamentally new approach to talent management. They describe how to: * Create a winning EVP (employee value proposition) that will make your company uniquely attractive to talent * Move beyond recruiting hype to build a long-term recruiting strategy * Use job experiences, coaching, and mentoring to cultivate the potential in managers * Strengthen your talent pool by investing in A players, developing B players, and acting decisively on C players Central to this approach is a pervasivetalent mindset-a deep conviction shared by leaders throughout the company that competitive advantage comes from having better talent at all levels. Using practical examples from companies such as GE, The Home Depot, PerkinElmer, Amgen, and Enron, the authors outline five imperatives that every leader-from CEO to unit manager-must act on to build a stronger talent pool. Written by recognized authorities on the topic, this is the definitive strategic guide on how to win the war for talent.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=simZCd_YUC4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_War_for_Talent.html?hl=&id=simZCd_YUC4C","pageCount":200,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2001"},{"title":"On War","authors":["Carl von Clausewitz","J. J. Graham"],"description":"On War is one of the most important books ever written on the subject of war. Clausewitz, a Prussian officer who fought against the French during the Napoleonic Wars, sought to understand and analyse the phenomenon of war so that future leaders could conduct and win conflicts more effectively. He studied the human and social factors that affect outcomes, as well as the tactical and technical ones. He understood that war was a weapon of government, and that political purpose, chance, and enmity combine to shape its dynamics. On War continues to be read by military strategists, politicians, and others for its timeless insights. This abridged edition by Beatrice Heuser, using the acclaimed translation by Michael Howard and Peter Paret, selects the central books in which Clausewitz's views on the nature and theory of war are developed.

Fussell illuminates a war that changed a generation and revolutionized the way we see the world. He explores the British experience on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918, focusing on the various literary means by which it has been remembered, conventionalized and mythologized. It is also about the literary dimensions of the experience itself. Fussell supplies contexts both actual and literary, for writers who have most effectively memorialized the great War as an historical experience with conspicuous imaginative and artisitc meaning. These writers include the classic memoirists Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Edmund Blunden, and poets David Jones, Isaac Rosenberg, and Wilfred Owen. In a new introduction Fussell discusses the critical responses to his work, and the books that have influenced his writing and thinking about war. Fussell also shares the stirring experience of his research at the Imperial War Museum's Department of Documents. Fussell includes a new Suggested Further Reading List.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_vXso80qrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Great_War_and_Modern_Memory.html?hl=&id=1_vXso80qrAC","pageCount":368,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2000"},{"title":"War and Change in World Politics","authors":["Robert Gilpin"],"description":"War and Change in World Politics introduces the reader to an important new theory of international political change. Arguing that the fundamental nature of international relations has not changed over the millennia, Professor Gilpin uses history, sociology, and economic theory to identify the forces causing change in the world order. The discussion focuses on the differential growth of power in the international system and the result of this unevenness. A shift in the balance of power - economic or military - weakens the foundations of the existing system, because those gaining power see the increasing benefits and the decreasing cost of changing the system. The result, maintains Gilpin, is that actors seek to alter the system through territorial, political, or economic expansion until the marginal costs of continuing change are greater than the marginal benefits. When states develop the power to change the system according to their interests they will strive to do so- either by increasing economic efficiency and maximizing mutual gain, or by redistributing wealth and power in their own favour.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2iKL7zr3kl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/War_and_Change_in_World_Politics.html?hl=&id=2iKL7zr3kl0C","pageCount":272,"rating":4.5,"publishedDate":"1983-11-25"},{"title":"Just and Unjust Wars","authors":["Michael Walzer"],"description":"e also examines the moral issues of warfare.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kZnx7WVJbeUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Just_and_Unjust_Wars.html?hl=&id=kZnx7WVJbeUC","pageCount":361,"rating":3.5,"publishedDate":"2006"},{"title":"War Made New","authors":["Max Boot"],"description":"An analysis of the pivotal role of technology in modern warfare focuses on four historical periods that shaped the rise and fall of empires, in a narrative account that covers such topics as gunpowder, the Industrial Revolution, and stealth aircraft.

Byerly"],"description":"The second edition of this pathbreaking, highly innovative comparative study in state-building by a major political scientist is a fully updated examination of the problems of making democratic government work. Sartori begins by assessing electoral systems. He attacks the conventional wisdom that their influence cannot be predicted and also disputes the view that proportional representation is always best and will deliver 'consensus democracy'. He argues that the double-ballot formulas deserve more consideration for their ability to facilitate governability in adverse circumstances. His comparative assessment of presidential and semi-presidential systems and the variety of formulas that are categorized, sometimes misleadingly, as parliamentary, looks at the conditions that allow a political form to perform as intended. He concludes with a detailed proposal for a new type of government: alternating presidentialism. This meets the need for strong parliamentary control and efficient government, with safeguards against both parliamentary obstructionism and government by decree, and so could help to avoid political paralysis in Latin America, in the post-communist countries of Europe and in countries with dysfunctional parliamentary systems such as Italy and Israel.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=haCUuvaj-58C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Fever_of_War.html?hl=&id=haCUuvaj-58C","pageCount":251,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2005"},{"title":"Vietnam: The Necessary War","authors":["Michael Lind"],"description":"Offering a controversial perspective on America's most painful war, the author proposes that Vietnam should have been fought, but with different tactics.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zvg1lr79qcEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Vietnam_The_Necessary_War.html?hl=&id=zvg1lr79qcEC","pageCount":336,"rating":3,"publishedDate":"2002-07-16"},{"title":"The Great War in History","authors":["Jay Winter","Antoine Prost"],"description":"This is a fully comparative history of the writing of the history of the Great War.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QRhcnK5rSP4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Great_War_in_History.html?hl=&id=QRhcnK5rSP4C","pageCount":250,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"2005-07-21"},{"title":"Material Christianity","authors":["Colleen McDannell"],"description":"Drawing on a rich array of historical sources and on in-depth interviews with Protestants, Catholics, and Mormons, this lavishly illustrated book examines the relationship between religion and mass consumption in America over the last 150 years. 100 photos. 24 color plates.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9qxO-FadNckC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Material_Christianity.html?hl=&id=9qxO-FadNckC","pageCount":324,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"1998-11-01"},{"title":"Christianity","authors":["Roland Herbert Bainton"],"description":"A critical portrait of Christianity follows its beginnings two thousand years ago to today, documenting such areas as the life of Christ, the rise of cathedrals and kings, the political climate of Rome, and the flight of the Puritans to the New World.

Drawing on texts that range from 18th-century female conduct books and contract theory to modern psychoanalytic case histories and theories of reading, Armstrong shows that the emergence of a particular form of female subjectivity capable of reigning over the household paved the way for the establishment of institutions which today are accepted centers of political power. Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of \"identity\" with a gender-determined subjectivity.

Although there is enough interest in the area to have spawned several societies, the literature is dispersed in a number of primary journals, with little in the way of integration of the material into a book. Dr. Martin is one of the best known researchers in the area, and his research goes across subdisciplines in psychology to be of wide appeal. This is a singly authored monograph that provides in one source, a summary of information researchers might wish to know about research into the psychology of humor.

Daniel Wickberg traces the cultural history of the concept from its British origins as a way to explore new conceptions of the self and social order in modern America. More than simply the history of an idea, Wickberg's study provides new insights into a peculiarly modern cultural sensibility. The expression \"sense of humor\" was first coined in the 1840s and the idea that such a sense was a personality trait to be valued developed only in the 1870s. What is the relationship between Medieval humoral medicine and this distinctively modern idea of the sense of humor? What has it meant in the past 125 years to declare that someone lacks a sense of humor? How is the joke, as a twentieth-century quasi-literary form, different from the traditional folktale? Wickberg addresses these questions, among others, using the history of ideas to throw new light on the way contemporary Americans think and speak. Specifically British meanings of humor and laughter from the sixteenth century forward provide the framework for understanding American cultural values in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1BkU0FBZl2EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Senses_of_Humor.html?hl=&id=1BkU0FBZl2EC","pageCount":267,"publishedDate":"1998"},{"title":"An Anatomy of Humor","authors":["Arthur Asa Berger"],"description":"People experience humor daily through television, newspapers, literature, and contact with others.

Gruner"],"description":"Humor, wit, and laughter surround each person. From everyday quips to the carefully contrived comedy of literature, newspapers, and television we experience humor in many forms, yet the impetus for our laughter is far from innocuous. Misfortune, stupidity, and moral or cultural defects, however faintly revealed in others and ourselves, seem to make us laugh. Although discomforting, such negative terms as superiority, aggression, hostility, ridicule, or degradation can be applied to instances of humor. According to scholars, Thomas Hobbes's \"superiority theory\"—that humor arises from mischances, infirmities, and indecencies, where there is no wit at all—applies to most humor. With the exception of good-natured play, Charles R. Gruner claims that humor is rarely as innocent as it first appears. Gruner's proposed superiority theory of humor is all-encompassing. In The Game of Humor, he expands the scope of Hobbes's theory to include and explore the contest aspect of \"good-natured\" play. As such, the author believes all instances of humor can be examined as games, in terms of competition and keeping score—winners and losers. Gruner draws on a broad spectrum of thought-provoking examples. Holocaust jokes, sexual humor, the racialist dialogue of such comic characters as Stepin Fetchit and Archie Bunker, simple puns, and many of the author's own encounters with everyday humor. Gruner challenges the reader to offer a single example of humor that cannot be \"de-humorized\" by its agonistic nature. The Game of Humor makes intriguing and enjoyable reading for people interested in humor and the aspects of human motivation. This book will also be valuable to professionals in communication and information studies, sociologists, literary critics and linguists, and psychologists concerned with the conflicts and tensions of everyday life.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J4q-tz81NdwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Game_of_Humor.html?hl=&id=J4q-tz81NdwC","pageCount":226,"publishedDate":"2011-12-31"},{"title":"Comic Relief","authors":["John Morreall"],"description":"Comic Relief: A Comprehensive Philosophy of Humor develops an inclusive theory that integrates psychological, aesthetic, and ethical issues relating to humor Offers an enlightening and accessible foray into the serious business of humor Reveals how standard theories of humor fail to explain its true nature and actually support traditional prejudices against humor as being antisocial, irrational, and foolish Argues that humor’s benefits overlap significantly with those of philosophy Includes a foreword by Robert Mankoff, Cartoon Editor of The New Yorker","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P9LVotZ2mH8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Comic_Relief.html?hl=&id=P9LVotZ2mH8C","pageCount":208,"rating":2.5,"publishedDate":"2011-08-24"},{"title":"Humor","authors":["Stephanie Paris"],"description":"Use the classics to teach fiction using leveled texts!

Accordingly, those ministering with families need a multifaceted, well-informed sense of both the Christian purpose of family and the complex world our families inhabit. Writing out of years of experience in the church and academy, Diana Garland here offers just such a broad and comprehensive introduction to this crucially important subject. Family Ministry begins with several chapters placing the family in its modern context, then considers the history of families and their interaction with the church. Having thoroughly contextualized the family and its concerns as they are now understood, Garland dedicates three chapters to biblical understandings of the family. The remaining ten chapters of her book are devoted to the practice of family ministry, including guidance on promoting strong families and dealing with crises such as divorce and spousal abuse. All this, based on careful research and seasoned reflection, makes Family Ministry not only a key text for students of family ministry but also an indispensable guide and resource for pastors and those in the helping professions.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8XImE9iLFcQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Family_Ministry.html?hl=&id=8XImE9iLFcQC","pageCount":629,"rating":4.5,"publishedDate":"1999-12-20"},{"title":"Our Young Family","authors":["Perry Deane Young"],"description":"This genealogy is the culmination of 45 years of research by best-selling author Perry Young.

In addition to addressing the family dynamic through which a given literary character develops a fully realized sense of self, family systems therapy allows readers to examine the patterns by which characters function in their larger intimate systems, whether those systems be social, institutional, or even global. As the intellectual foundation for the forms of therapy practiced by the majority of contemporary American and European psychotherapists, the study of family systems theory and its intersections with literary works affords readers with an illuminating glimpse into the terminology and processes involved in this dynamic form of critique. Perhaps most significantly, family systems therapy allows critics to consider the distinctly social interactions that characterise our pathways to interpersonal development and selfhood. John V.

Becker"],"description":"Imagine each family as a kind of little factory—a multiperson unit producing meals, health, skills, children, and self-esteem from market goods and the time, skills, and knowledge of its members. This is only one of the remarkable concepts explored by Gary Becker in his landmark work on the family. Becker applies economic theory to the most sensitive and fateful personal decisions, such as choosing a spouse or having children. He uses the basic economic assumptions of maximizing behavior, stable preferences, arid equilibria in explicit or implicit markets to analyze the allocation of time to child care as well as to careers, to marriage and divorce in polygynous as well as monogamous societies, to the increase and decrease of wealth from one generation to another. The consideration of the family from this perspective has profound theoretical and practical implications. For example, Becker's analysis of assortative mating can be used to study matching processes generally. Becker extends the powerful tools of economic analysis to problems once considered the province of the sociologist, the anthropologist, and the historian. The obligation of these scholars to take account of his work thus constitutes an important step in the unification of the social sciences. A Treatise on the Family will have an impact on public policy as well. Becker shows that social welfare programs have significant effects on the allocation of resources within families. For example, social security taxes tend to reduce the amount of resources children give to their aged parents. The implications of these findings are obvious and far-reaching. With the publication of this extraordinary book, the family moves to the forefront of the research agenda in the social sciences.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NLB1Ty75DOIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/A_TREATISE_ON_THE_FAMILY.html?hl=&id=NLB1Ty75DOIC","pageCount":424,"rating":3,"publishedDate":"1991"},{"title":"Politics","authors":["Aristotle"],"description":"Aristotle's Politics is a treatise on the subject of political science and government and is considered to be one of the greatest works on the subject from classical antiquity.

The Hewletts are the first anthropologists ever invited by the World Health Organization to join a medical intervention team and assist in efforts to control an Ebola outbreak. Their account addresses political, structural, psychological, and cultural factors, along with conventional intervention protocols as problematic to achieving medical objectives. They find obvious historical and cultural answers to otherwise-puzzling questions about why village people often flee, refuse to cooperate, and sometimes physically attack members of intervention teams. Perhaps surprisingly, readers will discover how some cultural practices of local people are helpful and should be incorporated into control procedures. The authors shed new light on a continuing debate about the motivation for human behavior by showing how local responses to epidemics are rooted both in culture and in human nature. Well-supported recommendations emerge from a comparative analysis of Central African cases and pandemics worldwide to suggest how the United States and other countries might use anthropologists and the insights of anthropologists to mount more effective public health campaigns, with particular attention to avian flu and bioterrorism.

Arguing that the fundamental nature of international relations has not changed over the millennia, Professor Gilpin uses history, sociology, and economic theory to identify the forces causing change in the world order. The discussion focuses on the differential growth of power in the international system and the result of this unevenness. A shift in the balance of power - economic or military - weakens the foundations of the existing system, because those gaining power see the increasing benefits and the decreasing cost of changing the system. The result, maintains Gilpin, is that actors seek to alter the system through territorial, political, or economic expansion until the marginal costs of continuing change are greater than the marginal benefits. When states develop the power to change the system according to their interests they will strive to do so- either by increasing economic efficiency and maximizing mutual gain, or by redistributing wealth and power in their own favour.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2iKL7zr3kl0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/War_and_Change_in_World_Politics.html?hl=&id=2iKL7zr3kl0C","pageCount":272,"rating":4.5,"publishedDate":"1983-11-25"},{"title":"Chinese Politics and Government","authors":["Sujian Guo"],"description":"Over the past two decades, China's political reforms, open-door policy, dramatic economic growth, and increasingly assertive foreign policy have had an unprecedented regional and global impact.

Drezner"],"description":"What would happen to international politics if the dead rose from the grave and started to eat the living? Daniel Drezner's groundbreaking book answers the question that other international relations scholars have been too scared to ask. Addressing timely issues with analytical bite, Drezner looks at how well-known theories from international relations might be applied to a war with zombies. Exploring the plots of popular zombie films, songs, and books, Theories of International Politics and Zombies predicts realistic scenarios for the political stage in the face of a zombie threat and considers how valid--or how rotten--such scenarios might be. Drezner boldly lurches into the breach and \"stress tests\" the ways that different approaches to world politics would explain policy responses to the living dead. He examines the most prominent international relations theories--including realism, liberalism, constructivism, neoconservatism, and bureaucratic politics--and decomposes their predictions. He digs into prominent zombie films and novels, such as Night of the Living Dead and World War Z, to see where essential theories hold up and where they would stumble and fall. Drezner argues that by thinking about outside-of-the-box threats we get a cognitive grip on what former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to as the \"unknown unknowns\" in international security. Correcting the zombie gap in international relations thinking and addressing the genuine but publicly unacknowledged fear of the dead rising from the grave, Theories of International Politics and Zombies presents political tactics and strategies accessible enough for any zombie to digest.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5_U0lhZVnlsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Theories_of_International_Politics_and_Z.html?hl=&id=5_U0lhZVnlsC","pageCount":168,"rating":3.5,"publishedDate":"2011-01-03"},{"title":"Politics of Touch","authors":["Erin Manning"],"description":"Printbegrænsninger: Der kan printes 10 sider ad gangen og max. 40 sider pr. session","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UaOwGZeFvPkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_Touch.html?hl=&id=UaOwGZeFvPkC","pageCount":195,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"2007"},{"title":"The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World","authors":["Joel Krieger"],"description":"A one-volume, A-Z encyclopaedia designed as a comprehensive resource for understanding the complex terrain of world affairs.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wd30pXJxpYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Companion_to_Politics_of_the.html?hl=&id=2wd30pXJxpYC","pageCount":1018,"publishedDate":"2001-08-02"},{"title":"Avoiding Politics","authors":["Nina Eliasoph"],"description":"Nina Eliasoph's vivid portrait of American civic life reveals an intriguing culture of political avoidance. Despite the importance for democracy of open-ended political conversation among ordinary citizens, many Americans try hard to avoid appearing to care about politics. To discover how, where and why Americans create this culture of avoidance, the author accompanied suburban volunteers, activists, and recreation club members for over two years, listening to them talk - and avoid talking - about the wider world, together and in encounters with government, media, and corporate authorities. She shows how citizens create and express ideas in everyday life, contrasting their privately expressed convictions with their lack of public political engagement. Her book challenges received ideas about culture, power and democracy, while exposing the hard work of producing apathy.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UC5PsXlGBNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Avoiding_Politics.html?hl=&id=UC5PsXlGBNoC","pageCount":330,"rating":4,"publishedDate":"1998-08-13"},{"title":"Aristotle's \"Politics\"","authors":["Aristotle"],"description":"One of the fundamental works of Western political thought, Aristotle’s masterwork is the first systematic treatise on the science of politics. For almost three decades, Carnes Lord’s justly acclaimed translation has served as the standard English edition. Widely regarded as the most faithful to both the original Greek and Aristotle’s distinctive style, it is also written in clear, contemporary English. This new edition of the Politics retains and adds to Lord’s already extensive notes, clarifying the flow of Aristotle’s argument and identifying literary and historical references. A glossary defines key terms in Aristotle’s philosophical-political vocabulary. Lord has made revisions to problematic passages throughout the translation in order to enhance both its accuracy and its readability. He has also substantially revised his introduction for the new edition, presenting an account of Aristotle’s life in relation to political events of his time; the character and history of his writings and of the Politics in particular; his overall conception of political science; and his impact on subsequent political thought from antiquity to the present. Further enhancing this new edition is an up-to-date selected bibliography.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DJP44GomyNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Aristotle_s_Politics.html?hl=&id=DJP44GomyNoC","pageCount":304,"publishedDate":"2013-03-29"},{"title":"On the Road","authors":["Jack Kerouac"],"description":"'Behind us lay the whole of America and everything Dean and I had previously known about life, and life on the road.

We're very proud of this book, an all-consuming project that has involved huge input from authors, staff, photographers and experts from around the globe. Like any serious addiction, the travel bug requires constant attention. If, like me, you consider travel to be an important part of your life, then this book will be bad news - it shows us that no matter how far we travel, there's always further to go. At Lonely Planet we believe passionately in the power of independent travel to transform travellers and the communities to which they travel. Bringing respect, sensitivity, curiosity and a generous dose of humour to the travel experience is enormously important, and we hope this book acts not just as a reference tool, but also as a valuable introduction to a better travel experience. Travel is the world's most important business, but it means far more than just money and employment. It is through travel that we go out and meet the world and the world cornes to meet us.

He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper.

In Questions of Travel, Caren Kaplan explores the various metaphoric uses of travel and displacement in literary and feminist theory, traces the political implications of this “traveling theory,” and shows how various discourses of displacement link, rather than separate, modernism and postmodernism. Addressing a wide range of writers, including Paul Fussell, Edward Said, James Clifford, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Baudrillard, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Soja, Doreen Massey, Chandra Mohanty, and Adrienne Rich, Kaplan demonstrates that symbols and metaphors of travel are used in ways that obscure key differences of power between nationalities, classes, races, and genders. Neither rejecting nor dismissing the powerful testimony of individual experiences of modern exile or displacement, Kaplan asks how mystified metaphors of travel might be avoided. With a focus on theory’s colonial discourses, she reveals how these metaphors continue to operate in the seemingly liberatory critical zones of poststructuralism and feminist theory. The book concludes with a critique of the politics of location as a form of essentialist identity politics and calls for new feminist geographies of place and displacement. An important and timely intervention into contemporary theoretical debates, Questions of Travel will be of interest to scholars in a wide variety of disciplines, including literary criticism, cultural studies, feminist theory, colonial and postcolonial studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology. /div","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=adKAO8zqZ_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Questions_of_Travel.html?hl=&id=adKAO8zqZ_cC","pageCount":238,"publishedDate":"1996-08-21"},{"title":"Making Social Science Matter","authors":["Bent Flyvbjerg"],"description":"Making Social Science Matter presents an exciting new approach to social science, including theoretical argument, methodological guidelines, and examples of practical application.

They provide substance to theories; they form the basis of measurement; they influence the selection of cases. Social Science Concepts: A Users Guide explores alternative means of concept construction and their impact on the role of concepts in measurement, case selection, and theories. While there exists a plethora of books on measurement, scaling, and the like, there are virtually no books devoted to the construction and analysis of concepts and their role in the research enterprise. Social Science Concepts: A Users Guide provides detailed and practical advice on the construction and use of social science concepts; a Web site provides classroom exercises. It uses a wide range of examples from political science and sociology such as revolution, welfare state, international disputes and war, and democracy to illustrate the theoretical and practical issues of concept construction and use. It explores the means of constructing complex, multilevel, and multidimensional concepts. In particular, it examines the classic necessary and sufficient condition approach to concept building and contrasts it with the family resemblance approach. The consequences of valid concept construction are explored in both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Social Science Concepts: A Users Guide will prove an indispensable guide for graduate students and scholars in the social sciences. More broadly, it will appeal to scholars in any field who wish to think more carefully about the concepts used to create theories and research designs. For Course Use: Social Science Concepts: A Users Guide has been written with classroom use in mind. Many of the chapters have been successfully taught at the Annual Training Institute on Qualitative Research Methods which is sponsored by the Consortium on Qualitative Research Methods. Feedback from those experiences has been incorporated into the text. Each chapter provides useful, practical, and detailed advice on how to construct, evaluate, and use concepts. To make the volume more useful, an extensive set of classroom exercises is available from the author's Web page at http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ggoertz/social_science_concepts.html.

They were written between 1903 and 1917, the most productive of Max Weber's life, when he was working on his studies in the sociology of religion and Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Weber had done important work in economic and legal history and had taught economic theory. On the basis of original investigations, he had acquired a specialist's knowledge of the details of German economic and social structure. His always vital concern for the political prosperity of Germany among the nations thrust him deeply into discussion of political ideals and programs. Weber's methodology still holds interest for us. Some of its shortcomings, from the contemporary viewpoint, may be attributed to the fact that some of the methodological problems that he treated could not be satisfactorily resolved prior to certain actual developments in research technique. These few qualifications aside, the work remains a pioneering work in large scale social research, from one of the field's masters.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TYvRby1ic6AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Methodology_of_Social_Sciences.html?hl=&id=TYvRby1ic6AC","pageCount":256,"publishedDate":"2011-12-31"},{"title":"Fuzzy-Set Social Science","authors":["Charles C.

We have to \"unthink\"—radically revise and discard—many of the presumptions that still remain the foundation of dominant perspectives today. Once considered liberating, these notions are now barriers to a clear understanding of our social world. They include, for example, ideas built into the concept of \"development.\" In place of such a notion, Wallerstein stresses transformations in time and space. Geography and chronology should not be regarded as external influences upon social transformations but crucial to what such transformation actually is.Unthinking Social Scienceapplies the ideas thus elaborated to a variety of theoretical areas and historical problems. Wallerstein also offers a critical discussion of the key figures whose ideas have influenced the position he formulates—including Karl Marx and Fernand Braudel, among others. In the concluding sections of the book, Wallerstein demonstrates how these new insights lead to a revision of world-systems analysis. Author note:Immanuel Wallersteinis the Director of the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilizations at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he is also an emeritus Distinguished Professor of Sociology.

In what ways are the legacies of religion--its powers, words, things, and gestures--reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about \"religion\" in other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return--sometimes in unexpected ways--the moment we attempt to do without it?This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask \"What is religion?\" Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking \"religion\" and \"religious studies\" in a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question \"What is religion?\" are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that \"religion\" is taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nI3i94U3NAMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Religion.html?hl=&id=nI3i94U3NAMC","pageCount":1000,"publishedDate":"2009-08-01"},{"title":"Religion, Conflict and Reconciliation","authors":["Jerald D. Gort","Henry Jansen","Hendrik M. Vroom"],"description":"Religion plays a part in many conflicts in the world. But what role? Is conflict usually economic and/or ethnic at root, with religion becoming a part of it only secondarily? Or does the very formation of a religious community itself lead to isolation, exclusion and conflict? Reconciliation often has religious roots: through religion people often come to understand that they are part of a greater whole and to realize that they must work at restoring good relationships with others in situations of deep conflict, and especially after direct conflict has ended. Religion, Conflict and Reconciliation: Multifaith Ideals and Realities, the authors of which represent five religious traditions, provides the reader with broad perspectives on the role of religion in conflict and reconciliation, with regard to both the actual processes involved and the central insights of the major religious traditions of the world.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VJ0UxLFlsiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Religion_Conflict_and_Reconciliation.html?hl=&id=VJ0UxLFlsiAC","pageCount":420,"publishedDate":"2002"},{"title":"Understanding Religion","authors":["Benson Saler"],"description":"This volume consists of 12 essays published by the author between the years 1997-2007, a thirteenth paper read at a conference in 2006, and a long introduction prepared specifically for the collection.

That problem is not concerned with preserving religious liberty, freedom of worship, and the toleration, in a particular society or in the world, of a diversity of religious institutions, communities, practices, and beliefs. It is concerned only with the question of where, in that diversity, the truth lies if there is any truth in religion at all.","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gzW3-sOwYxQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","link":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Truth_in_Religion.html?hl=&id=gzW3-sOwYxQC","pageCount":180,"rating":5,"publishedDate":"1992-04-01"}];
